It is a long established fact that a reader will be<br> distracted 
by the readable content of a page<br> when looking at its layout. 
The point of using<br> Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal<br>
distribution of letters, as opposed to using<br>'Content here, 
content here', making it look like<br> readable English. Many desktop 
publishing<br> packages and web page editors now use Lorem<br> Ipsum as
their default model text, and a search<br> for 'lorem ipsum' will
uncover many web sites still<br> in their infancy. Various versions
have evolved<br> over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> sometimes
on purpose (injected humour and the<br> like).
